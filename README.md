<hr/>

An anonymous platform to discuss and talk about your current role(s) or project(s) and find other 'reals' about roles you are interested in!

## Introduction

Have you ever had a job that sounded better than it actually was? Or a bad employer who you can't say anything about for fear of repercussion?

Worry no more, WorkReal is the solution for your deepest desires.

WorkReal is a single-page anonymous social network designed for mobile users. You see reals, the details of fellow professionals' workdays, sorted by closeness to your current role. You can also see all the reals for a single role of a single user--a workreal.

WorkReal is a way to get a feel for how your work compares with others in similar positions and to learn about roles that turned out differently than advertised. You will find both positive and negative workreals, and can send the role's holder a secret message to inquire for further details.

### Reals
Users will create 'reals' or posts about their day and experiences. Other users can follow along and gain deep insight into what your role entails or if they have a similar project, what working in that project environment may be like. Reals can be 'truthed' to show other users that the 'Real' only sounds like fiction.

### Google Maps
All roles are mapped out onto google maps where users can search for specific roles or a specific location to see what the job ecosystem looks like and if there are places where more software developers (for example) are located.

## Future Iterations

Allow users to follow roles so they can easily follow along with a certain 'Real' stream they enjoy.
### Implement Truths
Allow users the ability to 'truth' a real - cast their support and backup the real as being factual.
